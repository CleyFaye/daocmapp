; Each of the following sections configures a renderer named above. The
; renderer names don't matter; what matters is the 'type=' value.
;
; Valid types are:
;   solid: draws a solid color (for backgrounds etc)
;   background: draws the texture background extracted from texNNN.mpk
;   river: draws rivers
;   bumpmap: bumpmaps the current image using the terrain heightmap.
;   fixture: draws fixtures
;   bounds: draws bounds ("invisible walls")
;   grid: draws a coordinate grid
;   caption: draw some captions

[background]

; No extra params.

[bounds]

color = 150,0,0  ; color to fill prohibited area

; Fonts, if specified, turn on coordinate labels on the grid lines.
; Unfortunately, you still have to select a font that's the right size for
; your image by hand.
[grid]

[grid2]

[contours]
type = contour
interval = 1200  ; height interval between contours (starting at 0)
; alternatively, instead of interval use:
; steps = 20     ; number of contour steps per map

[river]
type = river
alpha = 90       ; alpha of river overlay
color = default  ; color of river overlay; default = use value from map data

[bumpmap]

light_vect = -1.0,1.0,-1.0   ; light direction vector (-z is 'down')

; A 'fixture' renderer specifies a number of sub-sections to use depending on
; the .nif being drawn. Anything not explicitly named uses the section
; named in 'default'. 'classify' delegates fixture classification to another
; section.

[altstructures]
type = altfixture
classify = fixture-classes
default = draw.none
collidee = draw.shaded   ; just trace what deasapear with collide = 0 in structures

;
; These are the fixture subsections.
;
; type is one of:
;   none: don't draw the fixture at all
;   wireframe: draw just the wireframe of the fixture
;      expects color=RGBA
;      use color=default to use the color specified by the map data
;   solid: draw and fill the wireframe 
;      expects fill=RGBA and outline=RGBA
;      use fill=none or outline=none to turn them off
;      use fill=default and outline=default to use the color specified by the 
;      map data
;   shaded: flat-shade and fill the wireframe
;      expects color=RGBA
;      use color=default to use the color specified by the map data
;
; layer controls the order in which fixtures are drawn. All fixtures in layer
; 0 are drawn first, then all fixtures in layer 1, and so on.
; (this ordering is per renderer instance, so it's irrelevant for the
; particular example below since I use two separate renderers anyway)
